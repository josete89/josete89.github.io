  <p>Not sure if all you knows anything about the <a href="https://www.adidas.es/gmr">GMR</a> product, my team and I were responsible for delivering a few software pieces to the project. During that time happened lot things good and bad moments and I want to share with you some lessons learned.</p>
<p><img src="https://media.vandal.net/i/1200x630/3-2020/2020351631755_1.jpg" alt="alt text"></p>
<p>First things first in case you didn&rsquo;t hear anything about it, let me explain you in a nutshell GMR is hardware product that basically detect your motion and movements when you are playing soccer and bring those from the real world to the virtual world, to FIFA mobile to be more precise.</p>
<p>To bring into life such a cool project you need to have proper engineering skills as well as leadership skills. In this post I will unveil all the techniques that helped me to steer my team from some difficult situation into a successful release of the product.</p>
<p>The key factors that helped me on that process were: <strong>safety, emotional intelligence, open mindset, clarity</strong>.I will go one by one and I&rsquo;ll describe the problem that the team had and how I applied each technique to improve the situation.</p>
<h2 id="safety">Safety</h2>
<p>This one is the most important one of all of them, all teams needs to feel safe to have a good performance and stay healthy. When I was drag into the team there were a conflict which split the team in 2 parts and I had tough times been there.
So I took up as a challenge and I decided to fix the situation, therefore I scheduled a meeting inviting all the affected persons in a face to face conversation.</p>
<p>In order to have a productive resolution I spent time to prepare a good environment for them to make them comfortable, I sit the team in a nice place where we can speak relaxed and also I brought water for every person. You don’t necessary need to bring water, but the idea behind this is make a safety environment which allows them to speak freely.</p>
<p>Then I started the conversation with these words &ldquo;what happen today in this room, it will stay in this room&rdquo; afterwards I started to openly speak about the problem, to bring the team to the same page. Then everyone spoke openly, we listen to each other as and outcome of that conversation we identified and fix the problem making both sides happy.</p>
<p>As you see is quite important create this safety environment within the team, where the people can openly speak. But when that happen is a great tool that allows you to help fix conflicts earlier or even prevent those.</p>
<p>A nice side effect is you boost the creativity of the team why is that? Because some people might not propose some ideas, they think are wrong and most probably people will laugh on them, but if they feel safe to speak they will propose crazy ideas that might help a lot!</p>
<h2 id="open-mindset">Open mindset</h2>
<p>Maybe this is one is really though sometimes, but we need to be open and challenge things. The way in that we perceive things meaning a lot for us and our performance, let put an example if you need to go to class you can say: “Oh I need to go to that boring math class” or “I have the opportunity to learn something new in that math class”.</p>
<p>You can image the same can be applied to the work, as I mention before instead
to runaway of the team. Because you imagine the situation just drag there and
conflicts doesn&rsquo;t sound good, I change my perspective and I take it as
a challenge instead of a burden.</p>
<h2 id="clarity">Clarity</h2>
<p>I think this is essential for the team, knowing the next steps or how looks like the thing that we want to achieve. How you can achieve something that you don’t know? You need to take this task on your shoulders and provide this clarity for the team, what we want to achieve and how to achieve it. Otherwise, the team can not focus properly on the work will, because they have doubts and concerns, all of this can be translated into a low performance and frustration from some members.</p>
<p>We fix this gathering all the needed info and also having touch bases to track
the team mood helps a lot. For example in this COVID times where everything is
unclear and there are lot of changes here and there, we scheduled a daily
catch-ups with the team members to speak about their feelings and this helped a lot.</p>
<p>Maybe you can think you have a lot of meetings but you can cancel the catch-ups when you feel
the team mood is better, also one advice the meetings with your team are
important and take it seriously. If you don&rsquo;t take it seriously, why the team
members will do it?</p>
<h2 id="emotional-intelligence">Emotional intelligence</h2>
<p>Sometimes is useful know other people feelings for anticipating to situations or just knowing useful information about them. In order to accomplish this we can use emotional intelligence, basically we use the following tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t multitask when you are speaking with someone from your team take it seriously,</li>
<li>Put the spotlight in the other person, sometimes when some is telling some anecdote, comes to our mind a thought we interrupt the other person to gain the focus on us. We need to prevent this interruption because, we don’t allow to the other person to express their feelings about that. We tend to use our feelings to determine how others feel.</li>
<li>Practice rapport, rapport is a communication technique where you establish a genuine connection with the speaker and the message you communicate to him really tug deeply. If you are interested this <a href="https://books.google.es/books?id=FiP2CQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=es&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">book</a> have a lot of good content.</li>
</ul>
<p>Whenever you start to apply those tips, you will notice your team confidence and happiness will increase, at least those worked form me. Maybe you need to find out how suits the best for your team, if those don’t work for you let me know!</p>
