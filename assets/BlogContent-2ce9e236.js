During that time happened lot things good and bad moments and I want to share with you some lessons learned. ",-1),f={class:"image image is-2by1"},w=["src"],_=g('<p class="blog_content is-size-5"> First things first in case you didn’t hear anything about it, let me explain you in a nutshell GMR is hardware product that basically detect your motion and movements when you are playing soccer and bring those from the real world to the virtual world, to FIFA mobile to be more precise. </p><p class="blog_content is-size-5"> To bring into life such a cool project you need to have proper engineering skills as well as leadership skills. In this post I will unveil all the techniques that helped me to steer my team from some difficult situation into a successful release of the product. </p><p class="blog_content is-size-5"> The key factors that helped me on that process were: <b>safety, emotional intelligence, open mindset, clarity</b>.I will go one by one and I’ll describe the problem that the team had and how I applied each technique to improve the situation. </p><h2 class="blog_content is-size-2">Safety</h2><p class="blog_content is-size-5"> This one is the most important one of all of them, all teams needs to feel safe to have a good performance and stay healthy. When I was drag into the team there were a conflict which split the team in 2 parts and I had tough times been there. So I took up as a challenge and I decided to fix the situation, therefore I scheduled a meeting inviting all the affected persons in a face to face conversation. </p><p class="blog_content is-size-5"> In order to have a productive resolution I spent time to prepare a good environment for them to make them comfortable, I sit the team in a nice place where we can speak relaxed and also I brought water for every person. You don’t necessary need to bring water, but the idea behind this is make a safety environment which allows them to speak freely. </p><p class="blog_content is-size-5"> Then I started the conversation with these words “what happen today in this room, it will stay in this room” afterwards I started to openly speak about the problem, to bring the team to the same page. Then everyone spoke openly, we listen to each other as and outcome of that conversation we identified and fix the problem making both sides happy. </p><p class="blog_content is-size-5"> As you see is quite important create this safety environment within the team, where the people can openly speak. But when that happen is a great tool that allows you to help fix conflicts earlier or even prevent those. </p><p class="blog_content is-size-5"> A nice side effect is you boost the creativity of the team why is that? Because some people might not propose some ideas, they think are wrong and most probably people will laugh on them, but if they feel safe to speak they will propose crazy ideas that might help a lot! </p><h2 class="blog_content is-size-2">Open mindset</h2><p class="blog_content is-size-5"> Maybe this is one is really though sometimes, but we need to be open and challenge things. The way in that we perceive things meaning a lot for us and our performance, let put an example if you need to go to class you can say: “Oh I need to go to that boring math class” or “I have the opportunity to learn something new in that math class”. </p><p class="blog_content is-size-5"> You can image the same can be applied to the work, as I mention before instead to runaway of the team. Because you imagine the situation just drag there and conflicts doesn’t sound good, I change my perspective and I take it as a challenge instead of a burden. </p><h2 class="blog_content is-size-2">Clarity</h2><p class="blog_content is-size-5"> I think this is essential for the team, knowing the next steps or how looks like the thing that we want to achieve. How you can achieve something that you don’t know? You need to take this task on your shoulders and provide this clarity for the team, what we want to achieve and how to achieve it. Otherwise, the team can not focus properly on the work will, because they have doubts and concerns, all of this can be translated into a low performance and frustration from some members. </p><p class="blog_content is-size-5"> We fix this gathering all the needed info and also having touch bases to track the team mood helps a lot. For example in this COVID times where everything is unclear and there are lot of changes here and there, we scheduled a daily catch-ups with the team members to speak about their feelings and this helped a lot. </p><p class="blog_content is-size-5"> Maybe you can think you have a lot of meetings but you can cancel the catch-ups when you feel the team mood is better, also one advice the meetings with your team are important and take it seriously. If you don’t take it seriously, why the team members will do it? </p><h2 class="blog_content is-size-2">Emotional intelligence</h2><p class="blog_content is-size-5"> Sometimes is useful know other people feelings for anticipating to situations or just knowing useful information about them. In order to accomplish this we can use emotional intelligence, basically we use the following tips: </p><ul><li class="blog_content is-size-5">Don’t multitask when you are speaking with someone from your team take it seriously.</li><li class="blog_content is-size-5"> Put the spotlight in the other person, sometimes when some is telling some anecdote, comes to our mind a thought we interrupt the other person to gain the focus on us. We need to prevent this interruption because, we don’t allow to the other person to express their feelings about that. We tend to use our feelings to determine how others feel. </li><li class="blog_content is-size-5"> Practice rapport, rapport is a communication technique where you establish a genuine connection with the speaker and the message you communicate to him really tug deeply. If you are interested this book have a lot of good content. </li></ul><p class="blog_content is-size-5"> Whenever you start to apply those tips, you will notice your team confidence and happiness will increase, at least those worked form me. Maybe you need to find out how suits the best for your team, if those don’t work for you let me know! </p>',20),v=r({__name:"GamerPost",setup(o){return u({app_name:"myblog",screen_name:"GamerPost"}),(n,t)=>(s(),l(d,null,[b,e("figure",f,[e("img",{src:m(y)},null,8,w)]),_],64))}}),k="/assets/reflection-d11e8b69.webp",I=e("p",{class:"blog_content is-size-5"},[i(" On a typical day, I engage at home workouts from time to time to stay in shape, and that’s the moment for me to listen to some podcasts.

I don’t want to spoil it with a summary of the episode, instead I will double click on the following quotes: <b>“Managers should be better programmers than the people they manage”</b> and <b>“How much do you trust your tests?”</b> As I have encountered these situations throughout my career, I want to share some learnings I got. Then let me dive into them one by one: </p><h2 class="blog_content is-size-2">Managers should be better programmers than the people they manage</h2><p class="blog_content is-size-5"> If this is your case with your team, congrats you are most probably living a honeymoon; therefore, you don’t need to read this part. Nevertheless, if you are still curious or is not your case I will share with you some tips and my experience being in both sides. </p><p class="blog_content is-size-5"> Throughout the majority of my career, my managers were quite adept with a strong technical badge, from whom I gained a lot of knowledge. Although there were one outlier, that experience was a bit tricky. The main issue was an overwhelming delegation, which, while offering a learning opportunity, also gave the impression that this person wasn&#39;t contributing much. </p><p class="blog_content is-size-5"> This is not the ideal situation, you feel there isn’t technical leadership because you end up solving the challenges. Also, if you feel that this person doesn&#39;t compensate for the lack of knowledge with commitment or soft skills, then we have a problem. </p><p class="blog_content is-size-5"> If this is happening to you, I want to offer you some advice: <b>Try to understand their context before passing judgment.</b> Why? You don’t know the situation of this person, maybe is having hard times and need a bit of support or time to getting back into action again. </p><p class="blog_content is-size-5"> In my case this person obviously wasn’t sitting there waiting for eight hours to pass by basically, he/she was doing work but no one of the team was aware of that. </p><p class="blog_content is-size-5"> Now that I’m in a similar role, staying up-to-date with technical topics is quite challenging. Due to the rapid pace of technological evolution, it&#39;s not easy to keep up if you&#39;re not regularly interacting with it. </p><p class="blog_content is-size-5"> Some practices I follow to avoid being disconnected from the technical side are: </p><ul class="blog_content is-size-5"><li>Participate in the PRs review, at least in a shallow manner.</li><li>Scheduling a biweekly meeting to follow the progress with the team and being deeper in the topics.</li><li>Be transparent in stand-ups.</li><li>Booking some time to go over GitHub trends, news, and blogs.</li></ul><p class="blog_content is-size-5"> Although it&#39;s valuable to stay up to date, what is needed in my opinion is to develop some intuition. This intuition should help you to identify something is not properly done or is too complex. For instance, if deployments require many manual steps, it takes a lot of time to develop a simple feature or if there&#39;s a disregard for HTTP verbs—like a GET operation inserting data into the database—it&#39;s a clear sign. </p><h2 class="blog_content is-size-2">How much do you trust your tests?</h2><p class="blog_content is-size-5"> Let me pose a question: <b>How many of you have worked on a project where 80% of the deployments ended up in a rollback?</b> In this scenario having a proper battery of tests and a robust CI pipeline will help to reduce the number of rollbacks. </p><p class="blog_content is-size-5"> The best time to address this is at the beginning of a project when you&#39;re laying the foundations. But it&#39;s not only about the moment, I see this as a good practice making this question to ourselves time to time. </p><p class="blog_content is-size-5"> Not everything is always smooth sailing, and sometimes businesses want to have new features as soon as possible. Therefore we forget to add tests or we are just dealing with a legacy project without any test, the question is How can we address this? </p><p class="blog_content is-size-5"> A good place to start doing test is in the orchestration layer, in case you have a micro service architecture. If that&#39;s not the case, and we have a monolithic application, the controller part is the one we should target first. </p><p class="blog_content is-size-5"> When conducting tests, an important consideration is to ensure they can run offline on your laptop. If that&#39;s not possible, it&#39;s an indication that there might be issues with the architecture, and it might be time to revisit this aspect. </p><h2 class="blog_content is-size-2">Conclusion</h2><p class="blog_content is-size-5"> As you can see, the lack of technical leadership is impacting your team negatively. </p><p class="blog_content is-size-5"> I want to share my two cents here. As engineering manager, I believe the North Star should be to prepare your team to make the right technical decisions. For me, this aligns with the statement Managers should be better programmers than the people they manage. </p><p class="blog_content is-size-5"> The feasibility of this may vary depending on the type of organization you work for. If you&#39;re working for a startup, it might be easier to achieve than in a larger company. Hiring a substantial number of highly skilled engineering managers is a challenging task, and you may need to prioritize which projects these individuals are assigned to. </p><p class="blog_content is-size-5"> If I’ve convinced you and you want to develop this intuition, here a few tips: </p><ul class="blog_content is-size-5"><li> To become more connected with technology, you can start working on spare projects that genuinely interest you. Personally, if I&#39;m not interested in a project, I tend to either quit or take a long time to complete it. For instance, I needed to learn Vue.js for my current project, and I redesigned this blog using Vue.js. </li><li> If you need to enhance your architectural skills, I encourage you to check out <a target="_blank" href="https://bytebytego.com/">Alex Xu&#39;s page</a>. </li><li> In case you&#39;re hungry to take your coding skills to the next level, exploring the world of data structures is a smart move.

Be transparent with your team as much as you can and try to invest small time to be aware of what&#39;s going on in the code. </li><li> Invest time in creating meaningful tests and building a robust CI. Ensure you can run locally your test otherwise review your architecture. </li></ol><p class="blog_content is-size-5"> Thanks for reading. </p>',27),j=r({__name:"ReflectionsPost",setup(o){return u({app_name:"myblog",screen_name:"ReflectionsPost"}),(n,t)=>(s(),l(d,null,[I,e("figure",z,[e("img",{src:m(k)},null,8,T)]),x],64))}}),A={class:"container is-fluid"},S={class:"content"},B={class:"is-size-1"},$={class:"is-size-5 blog_tag"},F={class:"columns"},q={class:"column"},C={class:"blog_information is-size-5"},N=e("br",null,null,-1),P={class:"column is-8"},D=r({__name:"BlogContent",props:{id:String,title:String,date:String,readingTime:Number,tags:Array},setup(o){const n=t=>t==null?void 0:t.map(h=>`#${h}`).join(" ");return(t,h)=>(s(),l("div",A,[e("div",S,[e("h1",B,a(o.title),1),e("h3",$,a(n(o.tags)),1),e("div",F,[e("div",q,[e("p",C,[i(a(o.date)+" ",1),N,i(" "+a(o.readingTime)+" min read ",1)])]),e("div",P,[t.$route.params.slug&&t.$route.params.slug==="team-behind-gamer"?(s(),c(v,{key:0})):p("",!0),t.$route.params.slug&&t.$route.params.slug==="reflections-over-the-years"?(s(),c(j,{key:1})):p("",!0)])])])]))}});export{D as default};
